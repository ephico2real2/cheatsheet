**Title:** Implement Flask PoC Lessons for Secure Secret Management

**Epic Link:** [Compliance & Security Improvements]

**Type:** Task

**Assignee:** [TBD]

**Reporter:** [Your Name]

**Priority:** High

**Labels:** Security, Flask, Refactoring, Kyverno, SecretsVolume

**Sprint:** [Sprint Number/Name]

**Description:**

Following the successful demonstration of secure secret management in our recent Flask application proof of concept (PoC), this task is dedicated to refactoring our existing Flask applications. The objective is to align them with the PoC's practices for managing secrets securely by reading from mounted volumes, thereby addressing Kyverno policy violations and enhancing our security posture.

**Objective:**

Incorporate the secure secret management approach demonstrated in the Flask PoC across all Flask applications within our portfolio. This involves transitioning from environment variable-based secret management to reading secrets from files in mounted volumes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **PoC Integration:** All Flask applications must adopt the secret management approach showcased in the Flask PoC, specifically reading secrets from mounted volumes.
   
2. **Updated Kubernetes Configurations:** Deployment manifests are to be revised to include volume mounts for secrets, as per the PoC configurations.
   
3. **PoC-Based Refactoring:** Implement refactoring changes that include the use of `secrets_loader.py` for loading secrets, adjustments to `config.py` for file-based configurations, and any relevant patterns from the `managedb.py` and `flask_secrets_watchdog.py` scripts for dynamic secret management.
   
4. **Documentation Update:** Provide updated documentation with step-by-step instructions on configuring and deploying Flask apps with volume-mounted secrets, directly referencing the Flask PoC implementations.
   
5. **Security & Compliance Assurance:** Ensure the refactored applications are compliant with Kyverno policies, with a special focus on secret management security measures. The applications must pass security reviews and Kyverno scans without any violations.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Review the Flask PoC codebase to understand the implementation details of the secret management mechanism.
- Collaborate with the DevOps team for the necessary Kubernetes setup and for any potential changes required in the CI/CD pipelines to support the new secret management approach.
- Conduct thorough testing to verify that secret management works as intended in various environments (development, staging, production).

**Resources:**

- Link to Flask PoC Repository: [https://github.com/ephico2real2/flask-dynamic-secrets-watchdog]

**Review and Testing:**

The implementation must be peer-reviewed and subject to rigorous testing, including automated tests to verify functionality and manual tests to ensure that the secret management mechanism aligns with our security requirements. The testing phase should also validate the seamless deployment of applications with the new secret management setup in Kubernetes.

### Title:
Create Helm Chart for Namespace-wide Logging Flow and Output Configuration via Logging Operator

### Description:
The objective is to develop a new Helm chart that simplifies the deployment of namespace-wide logging configurations using the Logging Operator. This Helm chart will facilitate the creation of a single Flow and Output CRD per namespace. These CRDs will be configured to select and forward logs from all application pods within the namespace that match a specified label, streamlining the logging process across multiple services. The creation of this Helm chart aims to enable easier, cluster-specific templating and deployment of logging infrastructure, ensuring consistent log management practices across our Kubernetes environments.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Singular Flow and Output CRDs**: Ensure the Helm chart dynamically generates a single Flow and Output CRD per namespace that can forward logs from pods matching a specific label.
2. **Label-based Pod Selection**: The Flow CRD must be configured to select pods based on a predefined label, which is added to all application deployments within the namespace.
3. **CloudWatch Integration**: The Output CRD should be configured to forward the selected logs to AWS CloudWatch, leveraging the Logging Operator's capabilities.
4. **Helm Chart Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation within the Helm chart, detailing how to deploy it across different clusters and explaining the label-based selection mechanism.
5. **Testing and Validation**: Demonstrate the Helm chart's functionality by deploying it in a test environment, verifying that it correctly identifies and forwards logs from the targeted pods to CloudWatch.

### Task Breakdown:
- [ ] Design the `values.yaml` structure to support namespace-wide Flow and Output configuration.
- [ ] Implement Helm templates for creating the Flow and Output CRDs with the necessary selectors and CloudWatch forwarding.
- [ ] Add a predefined label to all application deployments within the Helm chart to enable unified log selection.
- [ ] Write detailed documentation for the Helm chart, covering deployment instructions and the logic behind label-based pod selection.
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing in a controlled environment to ensure the logging configuration works as intended across different services.

### Priority:

### Epic Title:
Enhanced Monitoring and Logging for Applications

### Epic Description:
This Epic aims to consolidate and track the progress of various initiatives designed to enhance the monitoring and logging capabilities across our suite of applications. By improving our logging and monitoring infrastructure, we aim to achieve greater visibility into application performance, operational efficiency, and error diagnostics. This encompasses the development of new tools, such as Helm charts for streamlined logging configurations, the integration of advanced monitoring solutions, and the establishment of best practices for application observability. Our goal is to ensure that our monitoring and logging frameworks are scalable, easy to manage, and capable of providing the insights needed for proactive application management and troubleshooting.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All key applications and services must be covered by the updated monitoring and logging infrastructure.
2. **Scalability**: The solutions implemented must be scalable, capable of handling increased load and complexity as our environment grows.
3. **Ease of Management**: Logging and monitoring configurations should be easily manageable, with a focus on templating and automation to minimize manual intervention.
4. **Visibility and Insight**: The improvements must enhance our ability to gain insights into application performance and operational issues, supporting faster troubleshooting and resolution.
5. **Best Practices**: The initiative should adhere to industry best practices for application monitoring and logging, ensuring a robust and reliable observability framework.

### Tasks:
- Create a Helm chart for namespace-wide logging configuration using the Logging Operator.
- Integrate advanced monitoring solutions to provide deeper insights into application performance.
- Develop documentation and guidelines for implementing and managing the new monitoring and logging solutions.
- Conduct a review of current applications to identify any gaps in monitoring and logging coverage.
- Implement best practices for observability across all development teams, including training and resources.
