simple slide flow using your screenshots, in the “Start With This” format:


---

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title:
Fixing Vanity URL Frustration in ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift)

Subtitle:
How we modernized URL management using Kubernetes-native Ingress


---

Slide 2: What was hard? (Current State Pain)

Header:
The struggle was real...

Bullet points (recreate from your current slide "Challenges with Current Architecture"):

Ugly, long URLs in ARO (e.g., apps.cluster_name.demo.net)

Broken user experience between on-prem and ARO

No F5 support, no smooth SSL offloading

Certificate chaos, no centralized management


Visual:
Screenshot snippet from your Current State slide (crop to the On-prem + ARO comparison block only).


---

Slide 3: What did we build/change/ship? (Solution & Architecture)

Header:
We built a Kubernetes-native URL management approach

Bullet points:

Used Kubernetes Ingress objects for URL control

SSL via Kubernetes Secrets (no F5 needed)

Venafi integration for certificates

Helm templated Ingress for easy rollout

Uniform URLs across on-prem and ARO


Visual:
Use your "Basic Overview of Ingress to OpenShift Route" diagram.
(Optional: Add a red arrow to highlight the key improvement: Ingress --> Route)


---

Slide 4: How did it go? (Proof of Concept + Surprise)

Header:
It worked—better than we expected

Bullet points:

Validated successfully in RND environment

Seamless user experience restored

Cert management was simplified

Surprise: No more F5 dependency, 100% cloud-native


Visual:
Use the Proof of Concept section screenshot from your slide (crop only the green block with POC validated in RND and the Technical Business Value part).


---

Slide 5: If we had to do it again… (Lessons learned)

Header:
What we’d do differently

Bullet points:

Start with Kubernetes Ingress mindset from day one

Skip trying to retrofit F5 patterns into cloud

Recommend: Use Ingress + Venafi as a repeatable pattern for all apps



---

Slide 6: And now… (Call to Action)

Header:
Want to try it?

Bullet points:

Teams can now use the Helm chart template to deploy their branded URLs in ARO
