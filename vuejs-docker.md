Sure, here's an example of how you could structure a Jira story for dockerizing a Vue.js application for deployment on Kubernetes, aimed at a DevOps engineer:

---

**Title:** Dockerize Vue.js Application for Kubernetes Deployment

**Epic Link:** Application Deployment

**Type:** Story

**Assignee:** [DevOps Engineer's Name]

**Reporter:** [Your Name or the Project Manager's Name]

**Priority:** Medium

**Labels:** DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, Vue.js, NGINX

**Sprint:** [Appropriate Sprint Number]

### Description

As part of our efforts to modernize our application deployment process and ensure our Vue.js application is ready for cloud-native environments, we require assistance in dockerizing our current Vue.js application for deployment on Kubernetes. This involves creating a Dockerfile that not only builds our application but also prepares it to be served efficiently using NGINX in a production environment.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Dockerfile Creation:** Create a Dockerfile based on the provided specifications, with a build stage using `node:lts-alpine` and a production stage using `nginx:stable-alpine`. The Dockerfile should properly copy the Vue.js application and its build artifacts for NGINX to serve.

2. **Build and Test Locally:** Ensure the Docker container can be built and run locally, serving the Vue.js application via NGINX as expected on port 80.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment Configuration:** Provide a basic Kubernetes deployment configuration (YAML) that defines how the Docker container should be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, including considerations for scalability and management. This should include a Deployment, Service, and any necessary ConfigMaps or Secrets.

4. **Documentation:** Document the process of building the Docker container, running it locally for testing, and deploying it to Kubernetes. Include any prerequisites, such as Docker and Kubernetes setup.

5. **CI/CD Integration:** Outline steps or provide an example configuration for integrating this process into our existing CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the Docker image is automatically built and pushed to our container registry upon code commits.

### Notes

- The Vue.js application has already been prepared for production with a suitable `npm run build` configuration.
- Ensure the Docker image is optimized for size and build speed, leveraging Docker's cache mechanisms where possible.
- Security considerations should be kept in mind, particularly in the configuration of NGINX and the Docker container itself.

### Dependencies

- Access to the Vue.js application repository.
- Access to the container registry for pushing the final Docker image.
- Kubernetes cluster access for deployment testing.

### Out of Scope

- Advanced Kubernetes features like auto-scaling, advanced networking, or stateful sets are out of scope for this story.
- Full CI/CD pipeline setup or modification.

Please review and adjust the story as needed based on your team's specific requirements and workflows!
