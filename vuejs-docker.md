### Description

As part of our efforts to modernize our application deployment process and ensure our Vue.js application is ready for cloud-native environments, we require assistance in dockerizing our current Vue.js application for deployment on Kubernetes. This involves creating a Dockerfile that not only builds our application but also prepares it to be served efficiently using NGINX in a production environment.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Dockerfile Creation:** Create a Dockerfile based on the provided specifications, with a build stage using `node:lts-alpine` and a production stage using `nginx:stable-alpine`. The Dockerfile should properly copy the Vue.js application and its build artifacts for NGINX to serve.

2. **Build and Test Locally:** Ensure the Docker container can be built and run locally, serving the Vue.js application via NGINX as expected on port 80.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment Configuration:** Provide a basic Kubernetes deployment configuration (YAML) that defines how the Docker container should be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, including considerations for scalability and management. This should include a Deployment, Service, and any necessary ConfigMaps or Secrets.

4. **Documentation:** Document the process of building the Docker container, running it locally for testing, and deploying it to Kubernetes. Include any prerequisites, such as Docker and Kubernetes setup.

5. **CI/CD Integration:** Outline steps or provide an example configuration for integrating this process into our existing CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the Docker image is automatically built and pushed to our container registry upon code commits.

### Notes

- The Vue.js application has already been prepared for production with a suitable `npm run build` configuration.
- Ensure the Docker image is optimized for size and build speed, leveraging Docker's cache mechanisms where possible.
- Security considerations should be kept in mind, particularly in the configuration of NGINX and the Docker container itself.

### Dependencies

- Access to the Vue.js application repository.
- Access to the container registry for pushing the final Docker image.
- Kubernetes cluster access for deployment testing.

### Out of Scope

- Advanced Kubernetes features like auto-scaling, advanced networking, or stateful sets are out of scope for this story.
- Full CI/CD pipeline setup or modification.

Please review and adjust the story as needed based on your team's specific requirements and workflows!

Certainly, here's how you could structure a Jira story for creating a Docker Compose setup for the Vue.js application, along with a README for local testing guidance:

---

**Title:** Set Up Docker Compose for Local Testing of Vue.js Application

**Epic Link:** Local Development Environment Setup

**Type:** Story

**Assignee:** [Developer/DevOps Engineer's Name]

**Reporter:** [Your Name or the Project Manager's Name]

**Priority:** High

**Labels:** Docker, DockerCompose, Vue.js, LocalTesting, Documentation

**Sprint:** [Appropriate Sprint Number]

### Description

In order to streamline the local development and testing process for our Vue.js application, we need to create a Docker Compose setup that simplifies the process of running the application in an environment that closely mirrors production. This will involve configuring Docker Compose to run the application and any associated services (e.g., backend API, database) in containers. Additionally, we require a README file that provides clear instructions on how to use this setup for local testing and development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Docker Compose File Creation:** Develop a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the services required for the Vue.js application, including the application itself served via NGINX, and any other services it depends on. This should allow for the entire application environment to be spun up with a single command.

2. **Environment Configuration:** Include environment variable support in the Docker Compose setup to allow for easy configuration changes without modifying the service definitions directly.

3. **README Documentation:** Create a README file that includes:
   - Prerequisites for running the Docker Compose setup (e.g., Docker installation).
   - Step-by-step instructions on how to use Docker Compose to start and stop the application environment.
   - Information on how to access the application and any services in a web browser or through other tools while running locally.
   - Troubleshooting tips for common issues that might arise during the setup or use of the Docker Compose environment.

4. **Testing and Verification:** Ensure the Docker Compose environment works as expected by testing it on multiple machines, verifying that the application and all services start correctly, and are accessible for local development and testing purposes.

### Notes

- The Docker Compose setup should be designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, catering to developers who may not be familiar with Docker or Docker Compose.
- The README should be written in clear, concise language and include any necessary warnings or notes about potential pitfalls.

### Dependencies

- Access to the Vue.js application source code and any associated service codebases.
- Knowledge or documentation regarding any specific environment configurations needed for the application and services.

### Out of Scope

- Advanced Docker Compose features like swarm mode or Kubernetes integration.
- Setting up a full CI/CD pipeline for deploying changes made in the local testing environment.

This story aims to empower the development team by providing a robust, easy-to-use local testing environment that mimics production as closely as possible, thus enhancing productivity and reducing the time to identify and fix issues.


Certainly, here's a template for a Jira story focused on integrating the Vue.js application into an existing Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, utilizing a Helm chart for deployment:

---

**Title:** Integrate Vue.js Application into Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Using Helm

**Epic Link:** CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

**Type:** Story

**Assignee:** [DevOps Engineer's Name]

**Reporter:** [Your Name or the Project Manager's Name]

**Priority:** High

**Labels:** CI/CD, Jenkins, Helm, Vue.js

**Sprint:** [Appropriate Sprint Number]

### Description

We aim to streamline the deployment process for our Vue.js application by integrating it into our existing Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. This will involve adjusting our current Helm chart to accommodate the deployment needs of the Vue.js application, ensuring a smooth, automated deployment process to our Kubernetes cluster.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Helm Chart Adaptation:** Modify our existing Helm chart to support the Vue.js application, ensuring it can be dynamically configured for different environments (development, staging, production) through Helm values.

2. **Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:** Update our Jenkins pipeline to include steps for building the Vue.js Docker image, pushing it to our container registry, and deploying it using the adapted Helm chart. This should include any necessary stages for linting, testing, and conditional deployments based on branch or tag.

3. **Documentation Update:** Revise the CI/CD pipeline documentation to include the addition of the Vue.js application, detailing any new steps, configurations, or prerequisites required for successful builds and deployments.

4. **Testing and Validation:** Perform end-to-end testing of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that changes to the Vue.js application can be automatically built, tested, and deployed to the appropriate environment without manual intervention.

5. **Rollback Strategy:** Implement a clear rollback strategy within the pipeline for the Vue.js application deployments, allowing for quick recovery in case of deployment failures or issues.

### Notes

- Ensure the pipeline supports notification mechanisms for build and deployment statuses.
- Consider security best practices throughout the pipeline, especially when handling secrets and access permissions.

### Dependencies

- Access to the Jenkins server and necessary permissions to update the pipeline.
- Access to the source code repository of the Vue.js application.
