Here's a template for a JIRA story that you can use or modify according to your needs. This story outlines the task of using ArgoCD to install Twistlock, with an emphasis on using Kustomize for configuration management.

**Title**: Implement Twistlock Installation using ArgoCD with Kustomize Configuration

**Description**:

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our Kubernetes cluster security, we need to deploy Twistlock using ArgoCD. This will allow us to maintain continuous delivery practices for our security tooling. The deployment should be managed using Kustomize to align with our existing configuration practices and to ensure that we can easily manage environment-specific configurations through overlays.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Kustomize Configuration Setup**: A `kustomization.yaml` file must be created in the `base` directory. This base configuration should include all generic resources required for the Twistlock installation, such as secrets, cluster role bindings, cluster roles, and the Twistlock daemonset.
2. **Environment-Specific Overlays**: For each of our environments (e.g., dev, staging, production), create an overlay directory that contains environment-specific adjustments. These overlays will reference the base installation but allow for customization as per environmental requirements.
3. **ArgoCD Application Creation**: An ArgoCD Application should be defined to manage the deployment of Twistlock across our environments. This application will point to the Kustomize configurations.
4. **Readme Update**: The repository's README.md needs to be updated to reflect our usage of Kustomize for managing Twistlock deployments. It should include an overview of the structure, mentioning the base folder for generic configurations and overlays for environment-specific customizations.
5. **ArgoCD Sync**: Ensure that the ArgoCD application successfully syncs and deploys Twistlock across the targeted environments without errors.
6. **Verification**: Confirm that Twistlock is operational in each environment by performing a basic functionality test, such as scanning a test application.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Make sure to encrypt or securely manage any sensitive information included in the Kustomize configurations, such as secrets.
- Document any environment-specific considerations within the respective overlay directories for future reference.
- Coordinate with the security team to ensure that Twistlock configurations align with our security policies and requirements.

**Tasks**:
1. Create the `base` directory and populate it with the necessary `kustomization.yaml` and resource definitions.
2. Create overlay directories for each cluster environment with appropriate customizations.
3. Update the README.md to reflect the new structure and usage instructions.
4. Define the ArgoCD Application for managing the Twistlock deployment.
5. Test the deployment process in a non-production environment before rolling out to all environments.
