### Specific

- **Goal Statement:** "Within my role at JAMF, I aim to master the JAMF Kubernetes environment, focusing on the optimal deployment of the Datajar product, enhancing our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkinsfile, applying industry best practices for logging, monitoring, and security, and integrating advanced security measures such as moving from Kubernetes Secrets to using Secret Manager that mounts secrets as volumes, and enhancing the Jenkinsfile for multi-region deployment in AWS EKS. My objective includes a thorough understanding of how these components integrate and operate within JAMF's ecosystem to ensure a scalable, secure, and efficient deployment of our services."

### Measurable

- **Success Criteria:**
    - Complete specialized training on JAMF’s Kubernetes setup and its application to the Datajar deployment.
    - Successfully deploy Datajar in the JAMF Kubernetes environment, leveraging Jenkins for streamlined CI/CD processes.
    - Implement a robust logging and monitoring framework that supports proactive management and troubleshooting.
    - Implement Proof of Concepts (POCs) for moving away from Kubernetes Secrets to using a Secret Manager that mounts secrets as volumes, and for handling multi-region deployments in AWS EKS through Jenkinsfile enhancements.
    - Document and share a set of best practices and lessons learned with the team to foster knowledge sharing and standardization.

### Achievable

- **Action Plan:**
    1. Collaborate with JAMF's technical teams to gain insights and training on the current Kubernetes environment and Datajar’s requirements.
    2. Conduct a gap analysis to identify areas of improvement in our CI/CD pipeline, focusing on Jenkinsfile optimizations and security enhancements.
    3. Develop and test the deployment strategy for Datajar, incorporating best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability, including the integration of Secret Manager solutions and multi-region deployment capabilities.
    4. Design and implement a logging and monitoring solution tailored to the needs of the JAMF ecosystem.
    5. Execute POCs for advanced security measures and Jenkinsfile enhancements, evaluating their impact and effectiveness.
    6. Create comprehensive documentation of the deployment process, best practices, security enhancements, and troubleshooting guides for internal use.

### Relevant

- **Rationale:** "Enhancing my knowledge and skills in JAMF's Kubernetes environment, Jenkins CI/CD practices, logging and monitoring solutions, and integrating advanced security measures directly contributes to the successful deployment and management of the Datajar product. This initiative aligns with JAMF's strategic goals of delivering high-quality device management solutions and supports my professional development within the company. Additionally, addressing specific security concerns and deployment challenges enhances the resilience and global availability of our services."

### Time-bound

- **Deadline:** "I will undertake this project over the next six months, with the following milestones:
    - Month 1-2: Complete JAMF Kubernetes and Jenkins CI/CD training.
    - Month 3-4: Deploy Datajar and implement the initial CI/CD pipeline enhancements, including starting POCs for security and deployment improvements.
    - Month 5: Finalize the logging and monitoring setup and complete the POCs for advanced security measures and multi-region deployment.
    - Month 6: Review, document best practices, security enhancements, and share findings with the team."
