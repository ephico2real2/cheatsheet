**Status Report: Dell Cert-CSI Tools Implementation, OpenShift Cluster Upgrades, and GitOps Pipeline for OpenShift Webhooks**

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Prepared by:** [Your Name]

### **1. Summary of Work**
- **Dell Cert-CSI Tools Installation:** The Dell Cert-CSI tools for CSM Isilon drivers (version 2.6.1) were successfully installed and configured in the LAB2 environment for the MFTS OpenShift cluster. The tools were set up using local registry images due to the disconnected nature of the cluster.
  
- **Cluster Upgrades:** Both MFTS EWD PROD and MFTS PHX PRE clusters were successfully upgraded from OpenShift 4.12 to 4.14, with OpenShift 4.13 as an intermediary step. All MFTS IBM Sterling suite applications came online post-upgrade, confirming the success of the upgrade.

- **GitOps Pipeline for OpenShift Webhooks:** Collaborated with Thoai to create an automated ArgoCD deployment pipeline for OpenShift Webhooks, utilizing a GitOps approach.

### **2. Key Activities Completed**
- **Installation of Dell Cert-CSI Tools in LAB2:**
  - Dell Cert-CSI tools were installed and configured in the LAB2 OpenShift cluster.
  - The setup was customized to use local registry images in the disconnected cluster.
  - Certification reports were generated and shared with the MFTS team.
  - OpenShift 4.14 was confirmed to be compatible, and we are awaiting Dell to officially use the certification report as a reference for their support matrix.

- **OpenShift Cluster Upgrades:**
  - **MFTS EWD PROD:** Upgraded from OpenShift 4.12 to 4.14 via 4.13 with no downtime or major issues reported. All IBM Sterling suite applications came online successfully.
  - **MFTS PHX PRE:** Upgraded from OpenShift 4.12 to 4.14 via 4.13 successfully. Post-upgrade validation ensured that all IBM Sterling suite applications came online.

- **ArgoCD Deployment Pipeline for OpenShift Webhooks:**
  - Collaborated with Thoai to develop an automated pipeline using ArgoCD for deploying OpenShift Webhooks.
  - Implemented a GitOps approach to ensure continuous delivery and management of OpenShift Webhook configurations via ArgoCD.

### **3. Issues Encountered**
- No significant issues were encountered during the Dell Cert-CSI tool installation or OpenShift cluster upgrades.
- Minor adjustments were made to image path configurations during the Cert-CSI tool setup in the disconnected environment.

---

### **4. Next Steps**
- Monitor LAB2 to ensure continued performance of the Cert-CSI tools.
- Complete additional certification testing to validate full compliance.
- Plan upgrades for any remaining clusters based on the outcome of MFTS EWD PROD and MFTS PHX PRE upgrades.
- **Await results from Jason (Storage team) on the CSM CSI self-certification.**
- **Await Dell's official acknowledgment of the certification report for inclusion in their support matrix.**
- Follow up with the MFTS team for feedback on the certification report and plan for further implementations.
- Review and enhance the ArgoCD deployment pipeline for OpenShift Webhooks as needed for future environments.

---

### **5. Action Items**
- [ ] Monitor the performance of the upgraded clusters and address any post-upgrade issues.
- [ ] Schedule further certification tests in LAB2.
- [ ] Review feedback from the MFTS team on the certification report.
- [ ] Await feedback from Jason on the results of the CSM CSI self-certification.
