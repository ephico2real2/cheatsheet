Here are the Jira stories with descriptions added:

## STORY 1: Research MySQL 8.x Compatibility with Django Application
**Description:**
As a developer, I need to understand compatibility issues between our Django application and MySQL 8.x before implementing the upgrade. This research will identify potential problems and required changes to ensure a smooth transition from MySQL 5.7 to 8.x in our development environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Document known compatibility issues between Django and MySQL 8.x
- [ ] Identify required changes to Django settings for MySQL 8.x
- [ ] Create test criteria for validating application functionality

## STORY 2: Create Docker Configuration for MySQL 8.x
**Description:**
As a developer, I need a reliable Docker configuration for MySQL 8.x to replace our current MySQL 5.7 setup. Initial testing indicates that Bitnami's MySQL image provides better stability for our configuration needs compared to the official MySQL image.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Set up Bitnami MySQL 8.x Docker image 
- [ ] Configure proper volume mounting for data persistence
- [ ] Test configuration file handling (solving the copy vs. mount issue)
- [ ] Document the working Docker configuration

## STORY 3: Test Django Application with MySQL 8.x
**Description:**
As a developer, I need to verify that our Django application functions correctly with MySQL 8.x to ensure the upgrade doesn't break existing functionality. This includes testing database connections, migrations, and CRUD operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Verify database connection settings work properly
- [ ] Run existing migrations against MySQL 8.x database
- [ ] Test basic CRUD operations through the application
- [ ] Document any issues found during testing

## STORY 4: Document MySQL 8.x Upgrade Process
**Description:**
As a developer, I need clear documentation on how to upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to 8.x in the local development environment to ensure the team can implement the change consistently and with minimal disruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create step-by-step guide for developers to upgrade local environments
- [ ] Document any required code or configuration changes
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting tips for common issues
- [ ] Update development environment documentation

## STORY 5: Implement MySQL 8.x in CI/CD Pipeline
**Description:**
As a developer, I need our CI/CD pipeline updated to use MySQL 8.x to ensure all automated tests run against the same database version we'll be using in development and production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Update CI/CD configuration to use MySQL 8.x for tests
- [ ] Verify all automated tests pass with new database version
- [ ] Document any changes made to testing infrastructure
