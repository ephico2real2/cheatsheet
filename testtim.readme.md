Creating Testim GitLab CI scripts for your testing pipeline involves a few steps to ensure that your tests run smoothly in a GitLab CI environment, especially when moving away from Docker-in-Docker (DinD) due to Kubernetes runners. Here's an approach to set up your CI pipeline using the `testim/cli` Docker image and suggestions for managing this task in Jira.

### GitLab CI Configuration using `testim/cli`

#### Assumptions
- You have a GitLab CI/CD pipeline set up.
- Your GitLab runners are configured to run in a Kubernetes environment.
- You have access to the `testim/cli` Docker image and your Testim project's credentials.

#### Steps

1. **Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file**: This YAML file defines your CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Define the Test stage**: Use the `testim/cli` image to run your tests. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
stages:
  - test

testim-tests:
  stage: test
  image: testim/cli:latest
  services:
    - name: docker:19.03.12
      alias: docker
  script:
    - testim --token $TESTIM_TOKEN --project $TESTIM_PROJECT_ID --grid Testim_Grid --suite $TEST_SUITE_ID
  only:
    - master
```

- `image: testim/cli:latest` specifies the Docker image to use.
- `services:` allows you to use additional services like databases or other tools your tests might need. If `testim/cli` interacts with Docker directly, ensure compatibility with your Kubernetes setup or omit if unnecessary.
- `script:` runs your Testim tests. Replace `$TESTIM_TOKEN`, `$TESTIM_PROJECT_ID`, and `$TEST_SUITE_ID` with your actual Testim credentials and test suite ID.
- `only:` specifies the branch or branches where this job will run, adjust as needed.

#### Note:
- Ensure that your GitLab runner has sufficient permissions to pull Docker images and run them.
- Adjust the `services` section according to your specific needs or dependencies of your testing environment.

### Jira Story for Task Tracking

Create a Jira story to manage the migration task. Here's a suggested template:

- **Title**: Implement Testim Integration in GitLab CI Pipeline
- **Description**:
  - **Objective**: Convert existing Docker DinD GitLab CI pipeline to use `testim/cli` Docker image for running UI and end-to-end tests in a Kubernetes environment.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is updated to use `testim/cli` image for the test stage.
    2. Tests can be triggered and successfully run through GitLab CI on the `master` branch.
    3. Documentation is updated to reflect changes in the test pipeline setup.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  1. Review existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` and identify necessary changes.
  2. Test the `testim/cli` integration locally or in a development environment.
  3. Update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the new configuration.
  4. Monitor the pipeline execution and fix any issues encountered.
  5. Update project documentation.

- **Estimation**: [Add your estimated time here, e.g., X days]

- **Labels**: CI/CD, Testing, Automation

This approach gives you a starting point for migrating your CI pipeline to use the `testim/cli` image and managing the task through Jira. Ensure to adapt the GitLab CI and Jira story templates according to your project's specific requirements and standards.
