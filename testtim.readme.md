To adapt the provided GitLab CI configuration for Kubernetes runners and move away from a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) approach, you'll need to directly use the `testim/cli` Docker image to run your Testim tests. This adjustment involves specifying the `testim/cli` image in the job and modifying the script to directly execute tests within the CI pipeline environment, thereby eliminating the DinD setup. Here's how you can update the CI pipeline setup:

### Updated GitLab CI Configuration for Kubernetes

#### GitLab CI File: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
```yaml
stages:
  - e2e

testim:
  stage: e2e
  image: testim/cli:latest
  variables:
    TESTIM_TOKEN: <TESTIM_TOKEN>
    TESTIM_PROJECT: <TESTIM_PROJECT>
    TESTIM_LABEL: <TESTIM_LABEL>
    GRID_NAME: <GRID_NAME>
  script:
    - testim --token $TESTIM_TOKEN --project $TESTIM_PROJECT --label "$TESTIM_LABEL" --grid $GRID_NAME -r testim-report.xml
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - testim-report.xml
    reports:
      junit: testim-report.xml
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Image Usage**: Directly using `testim/cli:latest` eliminates the need for a Docker-in-Docker setup, aligning with Kubernetes' operational model.
  
- **Script**: Simplified to call Testim CLI directly, facilitating a straightforward execution within the CI environment.

- **Node.js Dependency**: If your project requires Node.js for steps outside of Testim CLI operations (like pre-test scripts or build processes), ensure these steps are managed either as separate jobs within your `.gitlab-ci.yml` that use a Node.js image, or integrated into your Docker image if custom.

### Preparing the Jira Story

To manage this transition effectively, outline a Jira story that captures the essence of the task and its requirements.

#### Jira Story: Implement Kubernetes-Compatible GitLab CI with Testim

- **Title**: Migrate to Kubernetes-Compatible GitLab CI Pipeline Using `testim/cli`
  
- **Description**:
  - **Objective**: Revise our current GitLab CI pipeline, replacing the Docker-in-Docker approach with a configuration that leverages `testim/cli` directly, facilitating compatibility with Kubernetes runners.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. Successful integration of `testim/cli` in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, removing Docker DinD dependency.
    2. Execution of Testim tests within the CI pipeline without issues.
    3. Documentation is updated to reflect the new pipeline configuration.
  
- **Sub-tasks**:
  1. Evaluate existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` for necessary updates.
  2. Test the `testim/cli` integration in a staging environment.
  3. Finalize and apply the `.gitlab-ci.yml` changes.
  4. Verify the CI pipeline executes successfully in the Kubernetes environment.
  5. Update the project documentation accordingly.
