**Summary:**  
Deploy KCS Webhook for OpenShift Alerts and Create Kustomize Patches for Dynamic Configuration

**Description:**  
The KCS webhook application was successfully deployed to the SDE OpenShift Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD. This application is used for alerting in OpenShift, and the following tasks were completed as part of this deployment:

1. Organized deployment artifacts for the KCS webhook application.
2. Created a deployment strategy involving the use of a token from a custom service account for communicating with the OpenShift Cluster API.
3. Implemented a `Secret` specification to handle token generation for the service account.
4. Verified that the deployment was successful in the SDE OpenShift Kubernetes cluster.

Additionally, to ensure the deployment is adaptable across different OpenShift clusters, the following tasks will be completed:

5. **Create Kustomize Patch for `OCP_URL`**:  
   A patch file will be created to dynamically manage the `OCP_URL` variable in the deployment spec, as the OpenShift Cluster API URL varies between target clusters.

6. **Create Kustomize Patch for Webhook Route Host**:  
   Another patch file will be created to manage the OpenShift route host for the webhook, as this varies for each target cluster.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Deployment artifacts for the KCS webhook are organized and stored in the correct location.
- [ ] The token from the custom service account is correctly used to communicate with the OpenShift Cluster API.
- [ ] The KCS webhook application is successfully deployed and functional in the SDE OpenShift Kubernetes cluster.
- [ ] Kustomize patch file for managing the `OCP_URL` is created and applied to the deployment spec.
- [ ] Kustomize patch file for managing the OpenShift route host is created and applied.
- [ ] Alerts are triggered as expected based on OpenShift events in the SDE cluster.
